This Java program initializes a memory size of 1000 and an empty allocation table. ‘allocateMemoryFirstFit’, ‘allocateMemoryBestFit’, and ‘allocateMemoryWorstFit’ functions allocate memory using First-Fit, Best-Fit, and Worst-Fit algorithms, respectively. deallocateMemory function deallocates memory, ‘calculateFragmentation’ function calculates fragmentation, and ‘calculateWastedMemory’ function calculates wasted memory. printAllocationTable function prints the allocation table. The main method shows the memory, allocation table, fragmentation, and wasted memory after performing some memory allocation and deallocation operations.
